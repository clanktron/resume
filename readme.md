# Resume

Dunno how well a git repo works with binary files but we're doing it anyway. Prolly gonna transition this to markdown and some sort of html/pdf renderer.

Might use pandoc with some custom html/css styling; i.e. html template with css style templates.

Saw some examples online so check ur starred repos...a few used SSGs like jekyll that looked nice so maybe that?
